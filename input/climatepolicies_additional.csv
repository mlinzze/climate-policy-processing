Ukraine's parliament approved an increase in the country's carbon tax from UAH 0.41 (US$0.01)/tCO2e to UAH 10 (US$0.4)/tCO2e as of January 1, 2019. The government also communicated intentions to increase the tax by a further UAH 5 (US$0.18)/tCO2e annually to reach UAH 30 (US$1.1)/tCO2e in 2023. As of 2021, the draft law is registered in the parliament and under consideration along with other initiatives to increase the rate of carbon tax. In addition, emissions below 500 tCO2e are no longer subject to the tax. This means that installations below this threshold are not liable to pay the tax from 2019.";;;"In force";2011;2011;;"Unknown";"Mitigation";"https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/2755-17#Text
